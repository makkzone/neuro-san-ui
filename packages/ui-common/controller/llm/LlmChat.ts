 * Send a request to an LLM and stream the response to a callback.
 * @param callback The callback function to be called when a chunk of data is received from the server.
 * @param signal The AbortSignal object to be used for aborting the request.
 * @param fetchUrl The URL to send the request to.
 * @param params Arbitrary parameters to send to the server.
 * @param userQuery The user query to send to the server (sometimes part of chat history instead).
 * @param chatHistory The chat history to be sent to the server. Contains user requests and server responses.
 * @param userId Current user ID in the session.
 * @returns Either the JSON result of the call, or, if a callback is provided, nothing, but tokens are streamed
