# Multi-Agent Accelerator

The Multi-Agent Accelerator is designed to help you visualize and interact with multi-agent networks while engaging in intelligent decision-making conversations.

## How to Use the Interface

1. Select an Agent Network from the Sidebar to view its structure.
1. Analyze the Multi-Agent Network Graph to understand agent interactions.
1. Enter a query in the Chat Window to receive AI-driven insights.

## Components

The interface consists of three main sections:

### 1. Agent Networks Sidebar

- Displays a list of available agent networks.
- Each agent network represents a group of AI agents working together to analyze and solve problems.
- Enables you to select a network to view its structure and interactions.

### 2. Multi-Agent Network Graph

- Provides a visual representation of the selected agent network.
- Nodes represent individual agents, and edges indicate communication and relationships between them.
- Helps you understand how agents interact to process information and generate decisions.

### 3. Chat Window – Query Interface

- Allows you to input queries and receive responses from the AI system.
- Queries are processed using LangChain-powered logic to fetch relevant insights.
- Responses may be influenced by the selected agent network and its internal decision-making processes.

## Other Considerations

1. Currently, there is no chat history, and agents do not retain memory. This is a planned feature for a future release.
1. The system is entirely read-only, meaning you cannot modify, edit, create, or save anything—including agents, prompts, or networks.
1. You can only use the built-in demo agents. The ability to create and customize your own agents is planned for a future update.
1. The agent communication animation may not always be perfectly accurate. As the back-end features are enhanced, communication will be more precise. For now, some approximation is necessary.
1. Regarding layout, resizing, and UI refinements—we’re aware of the current limitations. We're actively exploring ways to allow resizing, collapsing, and expanding elements.
