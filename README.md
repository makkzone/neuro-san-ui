# UI Developer Start Guide

This README is intended to help a new UI developer get up to speed toward making changes to the NeuroAI®️ UI code.

Note: Previously the project was known as UniLEAF and that name is still used in some places.

## Set Up Prerequisites

-   Install `nodejs` on your development machine. At time of writing Node 18 is the current LTS version.
    -   Example on mac: `brew install node@18`
    -   For Ubuntu, see this link: https://joshtronic.com/2022/04/24/how-to-install-nodejs-18-on-ubuntu-2004-lts/
    -   Make sure that the node executable is in your path. You can do this by typing `node --version`.
-   Install the protobuf compiler. This is needed to generate the protocol buffer files for the UI.
    Instructions for various platforms are [here](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).
-   Generate the protocol buffer files for the UI. This is done by running the following command in the `nextfront` directory:
    -   `yarn generate`
    -   This command will generate the necessary files in the `nextfront/generated` directory.
    -   To view the files: `ls nextfront/generated`
-   Install `yarn` on your development host. Instructions for all platforms are [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs)
    -   Example using current version on mac: `brew install yarn`
    -   For Ubuntu, see this link: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/self-update/
    -   Make sure that the yarn executable is in your path. You can do this by typing `yarn --version`.
-   Install app dependencies.
    -   Assuming you've cloned the UniLEAF repo: `cd unileaf/nextfront && yarn install`
-   Set environment variable to specify the gateway.
    -   Most likely you'll want the Dev environment: `export MD_SERVER_URL=https://neuro-ai-dev.evolution.ml`
-   In your `nextfront` directory, create a file named `.env` which contains the following keys.  
    Ask a current UI developer for the redacted values or get them self-serve from the leaf-team-vault server (see below).

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<redacted>

GITHUB_ID=<redacted>
GITHUB_SECRET=<redacted>

AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<redacted>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<redacted>
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://cognizant-ai.auth0.com/authorize
AUTH0_DOMAIN=cognizant-ai.auth0.com

# Next items are only needed if you're working on the LLM features of the UI such as the ChatBot or DMS assistant.
OPENAI_API_KEY=<redacted>

# Model names for the LLM features of the UI. Different models can be used for different features.
DMS_CHAT_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
OF_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
OPEN_AI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o

# Next items are for tracing langchain calls via langsmith: https://smith.langchain.com/
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your langsmith API key>
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=<set to true to enable>
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<choose any project name you want>

PINECONE_API_KEY=<redacted>
PINECONE_INDEX=prod
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1-aws

# Next item is if you want to use Bing search in Opportunity Finder
BingApiKey=ca930e94677e42d0b3b9ec86a75f4e0c

```

-   Instructions for generating NEXTAUTH_SECRET are [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret).
-   Values for most of the redacted items can be obtained from the `leaf-team-vault` server with these commands. Note:
    this assumes you have the vault cli installed and configured to talk to the `leaf-team-vault` server.
    -- `vault kv get /secret/auth0/unileaf-dev`  
    -- `vault kv get /secret/github-app/authorize-unileaf-dev`  
    -- `vault kv get /secret/nextauth/unileaf-dev`
-   Instructions on generating OPENAI_API_KEY are [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  
    You will need an active account with OpenAI to generate this key. This is only needed if you are working on the  
    LLM features of the UI.
-   Instructions on generating PINECONE_API_KEY are [here](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/authentication).  
    You will need an active account with Pinecone to generate this key. This is only needed if you are working on the  
    LLM features of the UI.
-   Be sure to chmod 600 this .env file to keep secret values secret

## Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or, by setting the UNILEAF_VERSION value, the ui will display your current branch
export UNILEAF_VERSION=$(git branch --show-current) && yarn run dev
```

To run with verbose debugging:

```bash
DEBUG='*,-send,-compression,-babel,-next:*' UNILEAF_VERSION=$(git branch --show-current) && yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Try making a simple change to the UI

If you've made this far, try a simple change within the UI. Here's an example:

1.  Open `nextfront/pages/projects/[projectID]/index.tsx`
1.  Add a message at the appropriate place in the tsx file (somewhere within the `return` statement, inside the `<>`  
    fragment).

             {`Hello world! The current project ID is ${projectId}`}

1.  You should notice that the code is compiled automatically and your change appears in the UI when loading a project.

### Congratulations, you are now a UI developer!
