# UI Developer Start Guide

This README is intended to help a new UI developer get up to speed toward making changes to the NeuroAI®️ UI code.

Note: Previously the project was known as UniLEAF and that name is still used in some places.

## Set Up Prerequisites

- Install `nodejs` on your development machine. At time of writing Node 18 is the current LTS version.
    - Example on mac: `brew install node@18`
    - For Ubuntu, see this link: https://joshtronic.com/2022/04/24/how-to-install-nodejs-18-on-ubuntu-2004-lts/
- Install `yarn` on your development host. Instructions for all platforms are [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs)
    - Example using current version on mac: `brew install yarn`
    - For Ubuntu, see this link: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/self-update/
- Install app dependencies.
    - Assuming you've cloned the UniLEAF repo: `cd unileaf/nextfront && yarn install`
- Set environment variable to specify the gateway.
    - Most likely you'll want the Dev environment: `export MD_SERVER_URL=https://neuro-ai-dev.evolution.ml`
- In your `nextfront` directory, create a file named `.env` which contains the following keys.    
  Ask a current UI developer for the redacted values or get them self-serve from the leaf-team-vault server (see below).

```bash  
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<redacted>  
  
GITHUB_ID=<redacted>  
GITHUB_SECRET=<redacted>  
  
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<redacted>  
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<redacted>  
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://cognizant-ai.auth0.com/authorize  
AUTH0_DOMAIN=cognizant-ai.auth0.com  
  
# Next items are only needed if you're working on the LLM features of the UI such as the ChatBot or DMS assistant.  
OPENAI_API_KEY=<redacted>  
  
PINECONE_API_KEY=<redacted>  
PINECONE_INDEX=prod  
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1-aws  
```  

- Instructions for generating NEXTAUTH_SECRET are [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret).
- Values for most of the redacted items can be obtained from the leaf-team vault server with these commands:    
  -- `vault kv get /secret/auth0/unileaf-dev`  
  -- `vault kv get /secret/github-app/authorize-unileaf-dev`    
  -- `vault kv get /secret/nextauth/unileaf-dev`
- Instructions on generating OPENAI_API_KEY are [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  
  You will need an active account with OpenAI to generate this key. This is only needed if you are using the  
  LLM features of the UI.
- Instructions on generating PINECONE_API_KEY are [here](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/authentication).  
  You will need an active account with Pinecone to generate this key. This is only needed if you are using the  
  LLM features of the UI.
- Be sure to chmod 600 this .env file to keep secret values secret

## Run the development server:

```bash  
npm run dev  
# or  
yarn dev  
# or, by setting the UNILEAF_VERSION value, the ui will display your current branch  
export UNILEAF_VERSION=$(git branch --show-current) && yarn run dev  
```  

To run with verbose debugging:

```bash  
DEBUG='*,-send,-compression,-babel' npm run dev  
```  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Try making a simple change to the UI

If you've made this far, try a simple change within the UI. Here's an example:

1. Open `nextfront/pages/projects/[projectID]/index.tsx`
1. Add a message at the appropriate place in the tsx file (somewhere within the `return` statement, inside the `<>`  
   fragment).

            {`Hello world! The current project ID is ${projectId}`}  

1. You should notice that the code is compiled automatically and your change appears in the UI when loading a project.

### Congratulations, you are now a UI developer!
