This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Set Up Prerequisites

- Install `yarn` on your development host. Example using current version on mac: `brew install yarn@1.22.19`
- Install `node` on your development host. Example using current version on mac: `brew install node@16`
- Install app dependencies. Assuming you've cloned the unileaf repo: `cd unileaf/nextfront && yarn install`
- Set env variable to specify the gateway. Most likely you'll want the dev namespace: `export MD_SERVER_URL=https://gateway-dev.unileaf.evolution.ml:30002`
- In your nextfront directory, create a file named `.env` which contains the following keys. Ask a current UI developer for the values.
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=redacted
GITHUB_ID=redacted
GITHUB_SECRET=redacted
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=redacted
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=redacted
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://cognizant-ai.auth0.com/authorize
AUTH0_DOMAIN=cognizant-ai.auth0.com
```

## Run  the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or, by setting the UNILEAF_VERSION value, the ui will display your current branch
export UNILEAF_VERSION=$(git branch --show-current) && yarn run dev
```

To run with verbose debugging:

```bash
DEBUG='*,-send,-compression,-babel' npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
