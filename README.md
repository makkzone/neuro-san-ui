# UI Developer Start Guide
This README is intended to help a new UI developer get up to speed toward making changes to the Unileaf UI.

## Set Up Prerequisites

- Install `yarn` on your development host.
  - Example using current version on mac: `brew install yarn@1.22.19`
- Install `node` on your development host. 
  - Example using current version on mac: `brew install node@16`
- Install app dependencies. 
  - Assuming you've cloned the unileaf repo: `cd unileaf/nextfront && yarn install`
- Set env variable to specify the gateway. 
  - Most likely you'll want the dev namespace: `export MD_SERVER_URL=https://gateway-dev.unileaf.evolution.ml:30002`
- In your nextfront directory, create a file named `.env` which contains the following keys. Ask a current UI developer for the values.
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=redacted
GITHUB_ID=redacted
GITHUB_SECRET=redacted
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=redacted
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=redacted
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://cognizant-ai.auth0.com/authorize
AUTH0_DOMAIN=cognizant-ai.auth0.com
```

## Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or, by setting the UNILEAF_VERSION value, the ui will display your current branch
export UNILEAF_VERSION=$(git branch --show-current) && yarn run dev
```

To run with verbose debugging:

```bash
DEBUG='*,-send,-compression,-babel' npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Try making a simple change to the UI
If you've made this far, you may try a simple change within the UI.
Here's an example:
- Modify `nextfront/pages/projects/[projectID]/index.tsx`
  - add a logging message at the appropriate place in the tsx file
    - ```console.log(`Loaded project: ${projectId}`)```
- You should notice that the code is compiled automatically and your change appears in the console output of the ui when loading a project.
