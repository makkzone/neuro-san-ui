# ================================================================================
# Cull NPM Packages Script
# ================================================================================
# Purpose: Clean up old non-release npm packages to prevent package proliferation.
#
# Usage: ./cull_npm_packages.sh <package_name> <package_owner> <retention_days> <dry_run> <min_keep_versions>
#
# Arguments:
#   package_name      - Name of the npm package (e.g., "ui-common")
#   package_owner     - GitHub org/user that owns the package (e.g., "cognizant-ai-lab")
#   retention_days    - Number of days; packages older than this are candidates for deletion
#   dry_run           - "true" or "false"; if true, no packages are actually deleted
#   min_keep_versions - Always keep at least this many most recent non-release versions
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN - GitHub token with packages:write permission (required)
#
# Retention Policy:
# - Release packages (version format: x.y.z) are NEVER deleted
# - Non-release packages (version format: x.y.z-main.sha.run or x.y.z-pr.sha.run):
#   - The most recent N packages are ALWAYS kept (regardless of age)
#   - Packages older than cutoff_date (beyond the most recent N) are deleted
# ================================================================================
