# Computes the npm package version and dist-tag for publishing @cognizant-ai-lab/ui-common.
#
# Usage: compute_publish_version.sh <event_name> <sha> <run_number> <package_json_path> [release_tag] [dist_tag_input]
#
# Arguments:
#   event_name:       The GitHub event name (push, release, workflow_dispatch)
#   sha:              The full Git SHA
#   run_number:       The GitHub Actions run number
#   package_json_path: Path to the package.json file to read base version from
#   release_tag:      (Optional) The release tag name (required if event_name is "release")
#   dist_tag_input:   (Optional) User-selected dist-tag for workflow_dispatch
#
# Output: Sets GitHub Actions output variables:
#   - version:   The computed npm package version
#   - dist_tag:  The npm dist-tag to use
#   - sha:       The full Git SHA (passed through)
#   - short_sha: The short (7-char) Git SHA
#
# Version formats by trigger:
#   - push to main:      <base>-main.<short_sha>.<run_number>  with dist-tag "main"
#   - release:           <release_tag> (without v prefix)      with dist-tag "latest"
#   - workflow_dispatch: <base>-pr.<short_sha>.<run_number>    with dist-tag from input
